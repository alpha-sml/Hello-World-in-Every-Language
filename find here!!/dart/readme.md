🧠 Fun Fact
Dart was developed by Google to make web and mobile app development fast and efficient. It’s the language behind the Flutter framework, which allows developers to build cross-platform apps for Android, iOS, web, and desktop — all from a single codebase. Dart’s syntax is clean, modern, and feels familiar to those coming from JavaScript or Java.

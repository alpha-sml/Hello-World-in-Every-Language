# 🧠 Fun Fact

Bash stands for “Bourne-Again SHell” — a pun on its predecessor, the "Bourne Shell" (sh), which was written by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs.

It’s the default command-line interpreter for most Linux distributions and Apple's macOS, making it one of the most common and powerful tools for developers and system administrators.

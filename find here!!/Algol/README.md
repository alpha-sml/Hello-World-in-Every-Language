üß† Fun Fact
Algol (short for Algorithmic Language) was a major intellectual achievement and the first language to be formally defined using Backus-Naur Form (BNF), a notation still used today to describe programming language syntax. Although it didn't dominate the commercial market, it heavily influenced the design of almost every structured language that followed, including Pascal, which itself was an influence on C.

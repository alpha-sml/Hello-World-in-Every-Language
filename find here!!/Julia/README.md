Julia
Year Created: 2012 Creator: Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah, and Alan Edelman


💻 Program File: hello.jl


println("Hello, World!")
Explanation: println is the standard function to print text to the console, automatically adding a newline.

⚙️ Compile & Run (Interpretation)
Julia code is typically executed directly by the runtime environment (interpreter).

Bash

# Start the Julia REPL (Interactive Session)
julia 

# Inside the REPL, you can type the code directly:
julia> println("Hello, World!")

# OR, run the file from your terminal:
julia hello.jl


🧠 Fun Fact

Julia was designed to be a "fast language." While 
many scripting languages (like Python) require 
extensive use of slow, pre-compiled C/Fortran 
libraries for speed, Julia achieves high performance 
by using a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler and 
specializing code for different argument types, allowing it to often approach the speed of C.

# Hello World in R 📊

This folder contains a simple R script that prints **"Hello, World!"** to the console.
R is a language built for **data analysis, statistics, and visualization**, but it’s also perfectly capable of handling simple tasks like this one.

## 🧠 About R

R was created in the early 1990s by **Ross Ihaka** and **Robert Gentleman** at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.
It’s especially popular among statisticians, researchers, and data scientists for its wide range of packages and easy-to-use plotting tools.

If you’ve ever worked with **ggplot2**, **dplyr**, or **tidyr**, you’ve already seen R’s powerful side.

## 📄 The Code

Here’s the code in all its simplicity:

```r
print("Hello, World!")
```

That’s it. No setup, no extra syntax — just straight to the point.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Check if R is installed

Open your terminal and type:

```bash
R --version
```

If you see a version (like `R version 4.4.0`), you’re good to go.

If not, install R using one of these methods:

* **macOS (Homebrew):**

  ```bash
  brew install r
  ```

* **Ubuntu/Linux:**

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install r-base
  ```

* **Windows:**
  Download the official installer from [CRAN R Project](https://cran.r-project.org)

### 2. Run the Script

Navigate to your R folder in the terminal:

```bash
cd "Hello-World-in-Every-Language/find here!!/R"
```

Then run:

```bash
Rscript hello.R
```

Output:

```
[1] "Hello, World!"
```

## 💡 Fun Fact

R’s logo — the blue “R” — actually stands for the **first letter** of its creators’ names: **Ross** and **Robert**.
Also, R has one of the most supportive communities in data science — you’ll always find a package for whatever you’re trying to do.

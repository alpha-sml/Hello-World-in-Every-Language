# 🧠 Fun Fact

Malbolge is considered one of the most difficult programming languages to learn and use. Named after the eighth circle of Hell in Dante's Inferno, it was designed to be as difficult as possible to program in. The language is intentionally obfuscated and uses a ternary number system with self-modifying code. It took two years after its creation before the first "Hello, World!" program was written in Malbolge!

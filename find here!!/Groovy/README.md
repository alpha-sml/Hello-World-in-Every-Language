# üé∏ Groovy Hello World

Welcome to the grooviest Hello World you'll ever meet! Get ready to say hello in style with Apache Groovy.

## üöÄ Prerequisites

Before you can groove with this code, you'll need:

- **Groovy** installed on your system (version 2.4 or higher recommended)
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 8 or higher (Groovy runs on the JVM)

### Installing Groovy

**Option 1: Using SDKMAN! (Recommended)**
```bash
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
sdk install groovy
```

**Option 2: Manual Installation**
- Download from [groovy-lang.org](https://groovy-lang.org/download.html)
- Extract and add `bin` directory to your PATH

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
groovy --version
```

## üéØ How to Run

Running this Groovy masterpiece is easier than tuning a guitar! Just use one of these methods:

### Method 1: Direct Execution (The Quick Way)
```bash
groovy HelloWorld.groovy
```

### Method 2: Using Groovy Console (The Visual Way)
```bash
groovyConsole HelloWorld.groovy
```
Then click the "Execute Script" button (or press Ctrl+R)!

### Method 3: As a Script with Shebang
Add `#!/usr/bin/env groovy` to the top of the file, make it executable, and run:
```bash
chmod +x HelloWorld.groovy
./HelloWorld.groovy
```

## üì§ Expected Output

```
Hello World
```

Yep, that's it! Simple, clean, and groovy! üéµ

## üé∏ Fun Facts About Groovy

1. **Born in 2003**: Created by James Strachan, Groovy became an Apache project in 2015.

2. **Java's Cool Cousin**: Groovy is 99% compatible with Java, but way more concise and expressive!

3. **Dynamic & Static**: You can have both dynamic and static typing in the same code. Talk about flexibility!

4. **Operator Overloading**: Make your operators do exactly what you want. The `+` operator can be anything!

5. **No Semicolons Required**: Unlike Java, semicolons are optional. Less typing, more coding!

6. **Built-in JSON/XML Support**: Parsing JSON and XML is ridiculously easy with Groovy's builders.

7. **Gradle's Secret Weapon**: The popular build tool Gradle uses Groovy as its DSL language.

8. **GStrings**: String interpolation that makes formatting a breeze with `${variable}` syntax.

9. **Closures Galore**: First-class support for closures makes functional programming smooth as jazz.

10. **MetaProgramming Magic**: You can modify classes at runtime - even those from the JDK!

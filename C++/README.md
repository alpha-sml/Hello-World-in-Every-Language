C++ Interactive Counter Program

This program demonstrates fundamental C++ concepts including basic input/output, conditional logic (if/else), and looping (while) to create a simple, interactive counter. The user can increment or decrement a value until they decide to exit.

ðŸš€ How to Run the Program

You need a C++ compiler (like g++ or Clang) installed on your system.

1. Save the Code

Save the code above as counter.cpp inside the C++ directory.

2. Compile the Program (Terminal)

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the C++ directory within the repository.

Use the following command to compile the source file:

g++ counter.cpp -o counter_program


g++: The GNU C++ compiler.

counter.cpp: The source code file.

-o counter_program: This option specifies the name of the executable file to be created (you can rename this if you prefer).

3. Execute the Program (Terminal)

Run the compiled executable using the following command:

./counter_program


(On Windows, you may need to type counter_program.exe.)

4. Usage

The program will prompt you for input.

Type + and press Enter to increase the count.

Type - and press Enter to decrease the count.

Type q (or any other non-+/- input) and press Enter to exit the program.

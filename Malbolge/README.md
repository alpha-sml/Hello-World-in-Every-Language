# Malbolge Hello World

## About Malbolge

Malbolge is an esoteric programming language designed to be as difficult to program in as possible. It was invented by Ben Olmstead in 1998 and is named after the eighth circle of hell in Dante's Inferno.

## Running the Program

To run the Hello World program:

```bash
malbolge hello_world.mal
```

```

## Interesting Fact

Malbolge is considered one of the most difficult programming languages ever created. It took nearly two years after its creation for the first Malbolge program to be written, and that program was generated by a beam search algorithm rather than being written by a human directly. The language uses a base-3 numbering system and its instructions are encrypted and modified during execution, making it extremely challenging to program in.

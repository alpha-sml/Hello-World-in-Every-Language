# C-- (C Minus Minus) Example: Hello, World!

This directory contains a basic example written in C--. C-- is designed as an intermediate language, making programs highly dependent on the specific underlying hardware or virtual machine environment.

## Program: `hello.c--`

This simple script demonstrates how to print a string to standard output, assuming a C-like runtime environment that provides standard external functions like `puts` and `exit`.

### Instructions

1.  **Compilation/Assembly:** This code must be processed by a C-- compiler or assembler (e.g., C-- Toolkit) targeting your specific machine architecture (e.g., x86, ARM).
2.  **Linking:** The compiled output must be linked against a library that provides the necessary external functions (`puts`, `exit`) for the target environment.
3.  **Execution:** Run the final executable file.

## Fun Fact

C-- was created by computer scientists **Simon Peyton Jones** and **Norman Ramsey**. Its primary purpose is to be an ideal language for compiler writers to target, lying at a higher level than traditional assembly language while remaining machine-independent.
